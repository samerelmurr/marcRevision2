            CSS positioning is a way to position elements on a page.
            There are 4 main types of positioning:
                - static
                - relative
                - absolute
                - fixed
                - sticky
            
            Static is the default positioning of elements on a page.
            Relative is a positioning that is relative to the static position of the element.
            Absolute is a positioning that is relative to the nearest positioned ancestor.
            Fixed is a positioning that is relative to the viewport.
            Sticky is a positioning that is relative to the viewport until it reaches a certain point, then it becomes relative to the nearest positioned ancestor.

            media queries are a way to change the styling of a page based on the size of the viewport.
            media queries are written inside of a @media rule.
            the @media rule takes a media query as an argument.

            media queries can be written using the following syntax:
                - @media (max-width: 600px) { ... }
                - @media (min-width: 600px) { ... }
                - @media (max-width: 600px) and (min-width: 300px) { ... }
                - @media (max-width: 600px), (min-width: 300px) { ... }
         -->
